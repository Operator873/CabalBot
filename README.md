# Wikimedia Watcher #
#### Watcher.py ####
This is a Sopel Bot plugin designed to watch only the pages you want to report changes on. Easy as pie commands.

#### Watcher2.py ####
Slightly more complicated in that it will allow you to follow a certain page in the same namespace on all projects.
For example, if you wished, you could follow \<User namespace\>:YourAccount on all projects, regardless of the language.
